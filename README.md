# Slim-Doctrine-Demo

[![.github/workflows/ci.yml](https://github.com/1ma/Slim-Doctrine-Demo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/1ma/Slim-Doctrine-Demo/actions)

A project to demonstrate how to integrate Doctrine 2.x into Slim. This is the companion
code for the Cookbook entry [Using Doctrine with Slim] in Slim's documentation.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1+
- PHP SQLite extension
- [Composer]

## Overview

The Slim-Doctrine-Demo project is a small REST API that allows its clients to
create and retrieve lists of users.

- GET /users    -> Retrieves a list of all users created so far.
- POST /users   -> Creates a new user (does not accept any parameters, fake data is autogenerated).

At its core, Doctrine's `EntityManager` is used to persist and retrieve these
users from an SQLite database.

```

## Running the app
Typing `composer serve` in a console will install the project dependencies, create the database and open
the API at `http://localhost:8000`. Once it is running you can make requests against it with a browser,
curl or similar tools.

```bash
$ curl -X POST localhost:8000/users
{
    "id": 2,
    "email": "oraynor@oconnell.info",
    "registered_at": "2022-01-15T23:10:51+01:00"
}

$ curl -X GET localhost:8000/users
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "email": "aratke@schroeder.com",
        "registered_at": "2022-01-15T23:10:50+01:00"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "email": "oraynor@oconnell.info",
        "registered_at": "2022-01-15T23:10:51+01:00"
    }
]
```

## Using the Doctrine Command Line Interface

Run `php vendor/bin/doctrine` (this script needs the project dependencies, so run `composer install` first).

## Running the tests

Similarly, typing `composer test` will take care of loading the testing environment and running PHPUnit. If the XDebug exension is enabled code coverage results will be available at `var/coverage/` after running the tests.
